# my_first_IS_project
My first Information System Project for school was a web-based service to find Pet-care services. The Pet-care industry is a niche that can benefit from automation of the Revenue Cycle of the Business Process. Therefore, a database of service-providers can be created to increase awareness of Pet-care services and service-providers.
