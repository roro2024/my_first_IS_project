# my_first_IS_project
My first Information System Project for school was a web-based service to find Pet-care services. The Pet-care industry is a niche that can benefit from automation of the Revenue Cycle of the Business Process. Therefore, a database of service-providers can be created to increase awareness of Pet-care services and service-providers. 

# Introduction
Companion animals become family to their host parents. Animals, like humans, have needs too. One important need for them is grooming, exercise and medical care needs. Typically, host parents are capable of providing at least one of these needs to their companion animal at a sufficient level. In most cases, however, the host parent requires external service-providers to assist in the caring of their beloved pet. For this reason, an efficient way of advertising such service-providers is through an online platform.

# Background
Some Pet-care service providers are well-established businesses that possess websites and a pretty good online presence. On the other hand, other Pet-care service providers are freelancers and can have a hard time getting their service widely advertised. This platform could be their way to increased revenue.
